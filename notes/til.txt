You can't edit embedded resources outside VS. They are baked into the binary.
Strings are compared by value in C# and by reference in Java. The only time you can be sure in C# that two strings with the same value also point to the same instance is compile-time literals.
You can create an instance by just new() in C# 8.0 if the type has been already resolved.
Interfaces can have properties in C# and it is just a shorthand for the getter and/or setter methods lol.
