Server/client image preview/full generation

	option 1: client-side configurator (better if there's too many options)
		start with this, do a MVP
	option 2: server-side generated image for given options (OK if it's just article + product combination)
		if option 1 no longer sufficient for the job
		
	resolution: probably eventually both but starting with option 1 as 1st iteration MVP is worth the extra work

Image composition

	display html in a browser window, then screenshot?
	(glue bitmap elements together?)

Elements handling
	
	break original page into elements, compose new page reusing some of them from scratch, send to browser.
	cut known unwanted elements from page, send the rest to browser as is.
